## Lukas Notes
0. Still need to add handling for security bugs and for 400 errors (bad bug typing) to bz_utils - need to kick things out of the queue if the bug is not responding more than N times
3. WOULD BE NICE - if builds cancelled by Self-Serve, note that in the message to the bug with final results (same if cancelled due to excessive time in incomplete pool - 6 hour default threshhold)
4. LDAP tests use Marc's email and he doesn't have LDAP anymore
8. There's a 10 minute gap between schedulerdbpoller runs so could you have an autoland push start & stop in that time with no report back?
8.1 HgPusher could send a message to schedulerdbpoller to create the empty cache file so that it's tracked from push time
9. Makefile & setup script for running this system in a virtualenv
10. Set up an archiving script for postedbug.log on cruncher - so we have history of usage
11. Nagios check top entry in cache files and warn about possibly hung builds
11.1 Cronjob to clean up .done files every 24 hours that are more than 24 hours old
12. Documentation, blogs, tweets, Yammers, Lightning Talk, Brownbag - get the word out
13. Start tracking bug for keeping track of bugs filed to this system
14. Long term planning: API implementation, Branch landings and map of requirements for each branch activated in this system, Bugzilla Extension for UI
15. WOULD BE NICE Try syntax for retrying oranges when below the threshold? Specifying the threshold?


## Marc Notes
0. Sometimes get a "bad msg" when trying to send to hgpusher (the first one on system start?) and yet that patchset gets a pushtime inserted to the db - should wait and retry it until a non-bad msg is returned -- when hgpusher fails it also sends a bad msg
1. The use case of "Flag bug for landing --> Wait for review --> land":
    -  Will not currently work, due to an early design mistake. The fix is
       fairly straight forward, but will require some time. I can redesign
       this and implement ASAP. I've outlined the necessary changes below:
        - When a tag is found by autoland_queue.py:bz_search_handler(),
          the bug needs to be checked for reviews in the case that it is
          a to-branch landing.
        - As it stands right now, the tag is pulled and entered into the queue
          and then when popped off the queue, the reviews are checked. 
        - autoland_queue.py:get_patchset() performs checking on the reviews
          based on try/branch. get_patchset() fails out and comments on bad
          reviews. This is NOT what we want.
        - We want to check the patch in autoland_queue.py:bz_search_handler()
          for the proper review permissions, and if they are not there, we
          simply ignore it until out next poll.
        - OPTIONS:
              o  change autoland_queue.py:get_patchset() to have a toggle on
                 comment posting, and use the get_patchset function to check.
              o  rewrite autoland_queue.py:get_patchset() to return a
                 pass/fail state, for example:
                    return (False, 'Autoland Failure Comment')
                 and only post the comment in the correct cases.
              o  I'm sure there are better ideas out there
        - NOTE: Check patch headers at this point, so users aren't waiting
                a while just for a failure.
2. A lot of this code needs to be cleaned up a bit. Some improvements I would
   like to make are:
    - Bugzilla represents its numbers as strings, but internally the autoland
      tools represent them as integers. There is quite a bit of type
      conversion and it would be nice to change that. Either convert at the
      earliest point, or internally store as strings. I prefer the former.
    - Simply fix some of the messy program flow, and code reuse problems.
    - After x # of retries on apply/push in hgpusher.py:apply_patchset(),
      clean_repo should be blown away and cloned again.
    - Get tests using a static test config, rather than the default config
      file.
    - After landing on branch, should set attachment flag checked-in+
3. The whole enforcement of "full headers" on patches might be a bit difficult
   & disliked, possibly leading to many issues with developers/bugzilla spam.
   They are not required on try runs, however they are for landing to branch.
4. There is a possible issue with db_handler.py:PatchSetGetNext(), where the
   SQL query might not pull a try run if mozilla-central (or whatever branch
   is in the branch field) is either above threshold or disabled.
5. autoland_queue needs to poll the database for jobs that have been in the queue for a long time
